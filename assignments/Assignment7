1. Open a local file, read the file line by line. Each line should be imported as a string and stored in ArrayList. Then print out the ArrayList reversely. You can create your own file to test.

2. Based on problem 1, create a button and textarea on the same layout. Each time you click the button, it will read a string from ArrayList in order and show it in the textarea. When number of clicks beyond the ArrayList, pop up an alert menu.
