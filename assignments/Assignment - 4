- Write a Java Program for Playing a Game. 
	Rules of Game : Computer will guess a number between 1 and 100. We should find that number in less than 5 chances.
	Computer will ask the person playing the game to guess the number. Computer will respond if the guessed number is greater or less than or equal to what computer has guessed..
	
	For eg:- Let's say Computer has guessed 67 (Person playing the Game will not know this)
	>>Please guess a number between 1 and 100 - You have 5 chances to guess
	>>32
	>>32 is less than what I've guessed - You have 4 chances to guess
	>>75
	>>75 is greater than what I've guessed - You have 3 chances to guess
	>>50
	>>50 is less than what I've guessed - You have 2 chances to guess
	>>67
	>>Congratulations! You've guessed it right and you guessed it in 3 chances..
	
	HINT : Use the following code to generate a Random number between 1 and 100
	Random randomGenerator = new Random();
	int i = randomGenerator.nextInt(100);
